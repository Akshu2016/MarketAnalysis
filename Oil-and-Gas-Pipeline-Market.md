In 2022, the market was valued at approximately USD XX billion, with a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of XX% from 2023 to 2030. This growth reflects the ongoing investments in pipeline construction and modernization to ensure efficient transport of hydrocarbons across regions, meeting the rising consumption of oil and gas globally.</p><h2>Oil and Gas Pipeline Market, By Application Segmentation</h2><p>The Oil and Gas Pipeline Market can be segmented by application into various categories, including transportation, distribution, and gathering. Transportation pipelines are primarily used to move crude oil and natural gas from production sites to refineries and processing plants. Distribution pipelines are designed to deliver processed oil and gas to end consumers, ensuring reliable supply to residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. Gathering pipelines play a crucial role in collecting oil and gas from production wells and transporting them to processing facilities, thereby supporting overall operational efficiency.</p><p>Additionally, the application segmentation extends to the offshore and onshore pipeline networks. Offshore pipelines are specifically designed for transporting hydrocarbons from beneath the sea to the mainland, catering to growing offshore drilling activities. Onshore pipelines, conversely, facilitate the movement of oil and gas across land, often facing unique challenges such as environmental regulations and land acquisition. Together, these segments illustrate the diverse applications of oil and gas pipelines, highlighting their essential role in the energy sector's infrastructure.</p></h3><h3 id="" class="">Who is the largest manufacturers of&nbsp;Oil and Gas Pipeline Market worldwide?</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Vallourec Tenaris</Li><Li> TMK Group</Li><Li> U.S. Steel Tubular Products</Li><Li> Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp</Li><Li> JFE</Li><Li> TPCO</Li><Li> ArcelorMittal</Li><Li> Chelyabinsk Pipe</Li><Li> Evraz</Li><Li> HUSTEEL</Li><Li> SANDVIK</Li><Li> National Oilwell Varco</Li><Li> Energex Tube (JMC)</Li><Li> Northwest Pipe</Li><Li> SB international Inc</Li><Li> Continental Alloys & Services</Li><Li> Jiangsu Yulong Steel Pipe</Li><Li> Jiuli</Li><Li> Anhui Tianda Oil Pipe Company</Li><Li> BOHAI STEEL GROUP CO</Li><Li> CNPC BAOJI PETROLEUM STEEL PIPE</Li><Li> HUBEI XINYEGANG STEEL</Li><Li> Tianjin Tiangang Special Petroleum Pipe Manufacture</Li><Li> CHANGBAO</Li><Li> WSP Holdings</h3><h3 id="ember53" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">Global&nbsp;Oil and Gas Pipeline Market Segmentation:</h3><p id="ember54" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Segmentation analysis involves dividing the market into distinct groups based on certain criteria, such as type and application.
